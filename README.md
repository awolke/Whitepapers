When looking into Blockchain driven Proof of Identity Services one of the challenges coming up is how do you link, or proof the identity of the HASH that was entered into the Blockchain. Say we use the Bitcoin Blockchain as a Timestamp Ledger which it was originally designed for. Say we want to protect our Intellectual Property (IP) of a Invention we made without paying excessive fees. We could go ahead and use a Service that let us create a HASH of the written Document say a PDF, then we add the unique HASH to the Blockchain OP_RETURN and after it has been verified by the Miner we have a timestamped Document. Is that Proof really enough? Is this holding up in Court when you have to proof that you are the Owner of that Document? What if you loose the original even.
